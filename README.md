# File-System
 This program simulates a File Allocation Table based file system
 
 
 This program provides a command line interface:
 <ul>
 <li>put name size - puts the given file into the file system</li>
 <li>del name      - deletes the given file with the matching name</li>
 <li>bitmap        - prints the bitmap as an 8x8 square of bits with the current block number</li>
 <li>inodes        - prints all the inodes, or files with the current stored position</li>
 </ul>
